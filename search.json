    "text": "About Statistics 205a\nThe course is designed as a sequence with Statistics C205B/Mathematics C218B with the following combined syllabus. Measure theory concepts needed for probability. Expection, distributions. Laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for independent random variables. Characteristic function methods. Conditional expectations, martingales and martingale convergence theorems. Markov chains. Stationary processes. Brownian motion.\n\nHours & Format\n15 weeks - 3 hours of lecture per week\n\n\nPrerequisites\nSome knowledge of real analysis and metric spaces, including compactness, Riemann integral. Knowledge of Lebesgue integral and/or elementary probability is helpful, but not essential, given otherwise strong mathematical background.",
